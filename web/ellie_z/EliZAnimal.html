<h1><em>CHIMPANZEE FOR PRESIDENT</em></h1>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Chimpanzees are one of the smartest animals in the world. </strong>Since chimpanzees are our closest animal relatives they have some of our brain power. We also share 99 percent of our DNA with them, so our genetics are pretty similar. 
    Chimpanzees have also able to solve problems (For example, using tools to obtain food) and understand languages, including having the ability to sign (sign language).
    So why should we vote for a chimpanzee instead of a human? 
	  After all, humans have created this community. Countless inventions should have proved a human would be better for the job. However, some people running for president could be both cunning and selfish. It's probable that someone could run with immoral intentions and win according to intelligence. They could make decisions just to benefit themselves. 
	  Chimpanzees, on the other hand, have less social capability than humans. I mean, why would you listen to a chimp building a tower for themselves? Good people could input ideas/opinions into the decisions, and if people are willing to have a chimp for president, chances are, they would like reliable colleagues for the chimp. This could be a good oppurtunity to get in good people and see past social bias, since chimpanzees didn't really do anything bad for humanity before. Therefore, having a chimpanzee as a president is a good idea.
